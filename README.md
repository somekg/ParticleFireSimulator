Particle Fire Simulator
-----------------------
Produces an animated continuous explosion from color-changing particles that have a box blur effect. Written in C++ with SDL Graphics Library. I wrote this program when I was following the [Cave of Programming C++ Beginner Course.
](https://caveofprogramming.com/p/c-beginners)
Creates a window using the SDL library and modifies individual pixels on the screen.


How to run
----------
The easy way to run it is downloading Visual Studio, and selecting the clone repository option and browsing it in GitHub, if you want to do it manually, although arguably a little more complex you'll have to download GCC/clang and do it on the command terminal, I don't have much knowledge on that so search a tutorial for it.
